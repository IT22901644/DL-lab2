1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

	As the number of hidden nodes increases, the model first fits the data better, but too many nodes make the boundary irregular.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

	Accuracy improves with more nodes at first, but after a point it may overfit and not generalize well.
